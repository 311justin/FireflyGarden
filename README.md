## Project Overview
This browser-based system evaluates children's pointing performance using Fitts’ Law.

Two input modalities are compared:
- Mouse
- Touch

The experiment records trial-level interaction data and computes:
- Movement Time (ms)
- Index of Difficulty (Shannon formulation)
- Throughput (bits/sec)
- Error Rate (%)

---

## How to Run
Option 1 (Recommended): Open the live system:  
https://311justin.github.io/FireflyGarden/

Option 2 (Offline):
Download this repository and open `index.html` in a modern web browser (Chrome, Safari, or Edge).

No additional installation is required.

---

## Dataset
All anonymised participant datasets are located in: /Datasets/

The folder contains individual CSV/Excel files for 24 participants under two conditions:
- Mouse
- Touch

No personal identifiers are included.

---

## Data Analysis Tool
The collected data was analysed using: Microsoft Excel (Microsoft 365)

Standard statistical functions and charts were used to compute averages, throughput, and error rates.

---

## Reproducibility
All source code and anonymised datasets are provided in this repository.  

The link will remain accessible for at least one year after submission.

---

## Ethical Consideration
All shared data has been anonymised.  

No identifiable participant information is included.
